# Short bio (displayed in user profile at end of posts)
bio: I am an undergraduate honours student at The Australian National University studying a Bachelor of Advanced Computing, specialising in Systems & Architecture and Intelligent Systems. I am supervised by Dr Marian-Andrei Riziou, on a project looking at disinformation campaigns in the Australian political context. My research seeks to answer the question of whether there is a 'formula' to create an effective disinformation campaign, with a special focus on analysis of the content of the posts users who are engaging in a disinformation campaign make.
