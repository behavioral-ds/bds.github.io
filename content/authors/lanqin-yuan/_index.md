# Short bio (displayed in user profile at end of posts)
bio: I am a postgraduate student pursuing a Master of Computing (Advanced) degree at the Australian National University, specialising in Machine learning. My research under Dr Marian-Andrei Rizoiu involves the use of transfer learning to improve the detection of hate speech in online text. Specifically, we seek to leverage multiple small datasets to create a generalised representation of hate which can be utilised by models and tasks downstream.
