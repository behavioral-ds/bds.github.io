  Hi, I'm Rohit. I'm a **PhD candidate at the University of Technology Sydney**, interested in how people exhibit opinions and behaviours in online social environments. \
  I'm interested in **online social behaviour and discourse modelling**, because I consider these incredibly important for understanding and mitigating modern phenomena. There are several modern challenges where this modelling helps; firstly, understanding and mitigating the spread of misinformation online (#5g #covid19 , #qanon, etc.), secondly, profiling characteristics and behaviours of online users (Voting practices, personality profiling, etc.) , and finally, identifying highly influential users and ideas. 
  I am formally trained in computer science and actuarial science, completing my Bachelor of Advanced Computing (Honours) and Bachelor of Actuarial Studies at the Australian National University in 2019. I continue to focus my learning toward statistical learning methods, data science practises, and research methods. \
  I also have a life outside of the office. In the mornings, you will find me in a headstand, doing some yoga routine. In the evenings, you'll find me curled up with a book. And on the weekends, you'll find me bouldering in an indoor climbing gym or going on adventures in the National Parks around Greater Sydney. \
  If you're interested in my research or just want to say 'hi', **send us a message on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/rohitram96)**.
