  Dr Marian-Andrei Rizoiu is a lecturer with the University of Technology Sydney, where he leads the [Behavioral Data Science group](https://www.behavioral-ds.ml/), studying human attention dynamics in the online environment. He is interested in stochastic behavioural modelling of human actions online, at the intersection of applied statistics, artificial intelligence and social data science.  
  
  His research has made several key contributions to applications such as online popularity prediction and real-time tracking and countering disinformation campaigns. For the past four years, he has been developing theoretical models for online information diffusion, which can account for complex social phenomena, such as the rise and fall of online popularity, the spread of misinformation, or the adoption of disruptive technologies. He approached questions such as "Why did X become popular, but not Y?" and "How can problematic content be detected based solely on how it spreads?" with implications in detecting the spread of conspiracy theories and disinformation campaigns. Marian-Andrei also works in understanding shortages and mismatches in labour markets. Together with his collaborators, he built a real-time occupation transition recommender system usable in periods of massive disruptions (such as COVID-19). He also has shown that social-media predicted personality profiles are linked with worker occupation.  
  
  Marian-Andrei has published in the most selective venues, such as the PNAS, WWW, WSDM, ICWSM, and CIKM. His work has received significant media attention—including
