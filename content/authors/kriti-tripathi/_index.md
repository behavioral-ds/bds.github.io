  **Next position after UTS:** Kriti continued her undergraduate studies at the Australian National University.
  
bio: I am an undergraduate student at The Australian National University undertaking a double degree in Bachelor of Advanced Computing (Honours)/Bachelor of Science (Theoretical Physics, Astronomy & Astrophysics). I am supervised by Dr Marian-Andrei Rizoiu. My current research focuses on profiling information warfare on social media which I am exploring via a case study using the data from the 2019 Australian Elections. Within my research, I am looking at being able to characterize the spread of misinformation on social media, identify the opinion leaders that drove the conversations during the 2019 elections online on Twitter and explore how this misinformation has spread to traditional media like radio and newspaper.
