# Short bio (displayed in user profile at end of posts)
bio: I am an undergraduate student at The Australian National University currently studying a double degree in Bachelor of Advanced Computing and Bachelor of Actuarial Studies, supervised by Dr Marian-Andrei Rizoiu. My research involves looking into opinion polarisation dynamics - specifically concerning the Brexit debate on social media. The main aim is to detect stance shifts along with determining if a user's future stance can be predicted based on the other users they have interacted with (who may have varying stances) and types of discussions they have been exposed to.
