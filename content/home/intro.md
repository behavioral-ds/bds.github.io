The Behavioral Data Science lab is a research group in the UTS Data Science Institute at the [University of Technology Sydney](https://www.uts.edu.au/), Australia.

Our research aims to make sense of large amounts of behavioral data, to understand online behavior and its offline effects. We develop core methods in machine learning and optimization in order to distill heaps of raw data into meaningful insights in areas including
* social and information network analysis,
* information diffusion across social networks,
* mis- and dis-information spreading,
* tomorrow's labour markets and labour transitions,
* machine learning,
* computational social science,
* data mining, and
* natural language processing
